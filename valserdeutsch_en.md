# Arrangement of Words

## Headwords and Equivalents

The headwords in the main part of the dictionary are highlighted in bold. As a rule, the base form of the word is given, inflections are only exceptionally listed as headwords.

The corresponding standard language (written German) meaning of the headwords are frequently supplemented with dialect examples, idioms (Ra.) or special turns of phrase.

Place names are based on the official nomenclature. Dialect designations deviating from this are set in italics (oblique), e.g. *Fleis* for the place name Leis, *Ganaal* for the side valley Canal. The national maps 1:25,000 form the basis in each case: Sheet 1234 VALS, Edition 2000, Sheet 1254 HINTERRHEIN, Edition 2004, and Sheet 1253 OLIVONE, Edition 1989. Trigonometric points on the national map (e.g. Point 1825) specify many place names as elevation markers.

## 

## Nouns (Substantive)

The grammatical gender is added directly to the noun (substantive). If a noun stands without plural form, singular and plural are the same.

## 

## Verbs

Some auxiliary verbs are additionally supplemented by frequently used conjugated forms.

## 

## Standard Language Register

The standard language (written German) register is not only to be understood as a translation of the words, it should rather point to possible equivalents in dialect.

# Notes on Language and Spelling

Every dialect has its particular sound in addition to its special vocabulary. The Vals dialect can still be recognized today by its partly archaic character in pronunciation and vocabulary. Here some special features are presented:

**Characteristic sch:** *Hüüscher* (houses), *Lüüsch* (lice); *Müüsch* (mice).

**Preservation of diphthong (double sound/diphthong)** *öi,* of **umlaut** *ü* as well as the **affricate** *pf: Flöiga* (fly), *töif* (deep), *Göichi* (simplicity), *Sücka* (swamp), *Lücka* (gap), *Pfänschter* (window), *Pflegel* (flail), *pfuufa* (hiss). The diphthong *ei* is to be pronounced as *e i* and not as *ai*.

**2nd and 3rd person singular** of go, stand, know etc. formed with diphthong: *geischt, steischt, weischt.*

**Consonant loss:** *Hoora* (horn), *Turra* (tower), *Wurra* (worm).

**Adaptation of endings of predicative adjective to gender and number:** *är/er ischt chranka, äs/es ischt chranks, schii ischt/sind chranki.*

**Typical diminutives (diminutive forms): *...li:*** *Bäsemli* (little broom), *Broggli* (small wooden vessel), *Tschiferli* (small backpack basket); ***...schi:** Bämschi* (little lamb), *Hüüschi* (little house), *Müüschi* (little mouse); ***...elti:** Engelti* (little angel), *Hobschelti* (little frog), *Gasselti* (little alley). Diminutives are also frequent with given names: *ds Andreesli, ds Agneesi, ds Alewiisi, ds Bernhartli, ds Franzischgi* etc.

**Local special developments:** *michla* (steal wood, Old High German mihillon \= enlarge). *Zeewa* (toe, Old High German zeha). *Das macha täti nit* (I wouldn't do that).

**Foreign language influences on vocabulary and syntax (sentence structure)** frequently from Romansh and Italian: *Balma* (cave, overhanging rock, typical word of the Southwest Walser). *Bränta* (wooden bucket, fog, intoxication, Romansh 'brenta'). *Fatscha* (face, Romansh 'fatscha'/Italian 'faccia'). *Parisool* (umbrella, French 'parasol'). *Schgarnutz* (paper bag, Romansh 'scarnuz'). *Tscheera* (expression, face, Romansh 'tschera'), *Zmaränt* (afternoon snack, snack, Italian 'marenda'). *Es macht chaalt* (Italian/Romansh 'fa freddo/fraid', it is/becomes cold).

**Relics from old languages:** *Ägerta* (field name, former field, mhd. egerid \= what has been plowed around). *Máss* (boiled Alpine dock as pig feed, Old High German/Gothic). *sum* (some, some things, some things, a part, Gothic sums for 'some').

## 

## Writing Words as You Hear Them

An exact reproduction of the Valser German dialect would require phonetic spelling. In the interest of reader-friendliness, this dictionary tries to make do with the usual character set of the alphabet and uses **moderate phonetic transcription.** Basically, words are to be written as one hears them. And put differently: Despite all welcome rules, there should indeed remain room for a rather free transcription of dialects.

## 

## Vowels

**Long vowels in Valsertütsch receive a doubling:** *Aabet* (evening), *es Aabetsch* (one evening), *Eeberi* (larger snow-free area), *Iisch* (ice), *Noot* (distress), *Nööhi* (nearness), *Hüüscher* (houses), *puura* (be engaged in farming). Thus the lengthening *\-ie* and *\-h* are dropped. Where *ie* appears, the e is also to be pronounced: *iecha* (in here), *ier* (you \[plural\]), *nie* (never). The ei-sound is spoken with closed e.

The diphthongs *au* and partly also *eu* are colored toward o in dialect, which is why: *Boum, Böum,* (tree, trees), *Frou* (woman), *Höu* (hay), *höuwa* (make hay) is written. For the sake of reader-friendliness, I write *Büecher,* although the sound would rather demand *Büöcher*.

**The *a, aa* generally sound bright:** *afaa* (begin), *afanga/áfa* (already), *abenandera* (apart), *apaarti* (especially), *a dr Wand* (on the wall).

The **vowels *a* and *e*** at the end of a word sound **like an open short *ä*.** I adhere to Jörger and always write ***a*** **as the final sound:** *Bära* (bear), *Maana* (moon), *ma* (one), *notta* (nevertheless), *oosa* (annoy).

**The unstressed middle syllable** is rendered with a **colorlessly sounding *e*:** *Lägela* (large wooden vessel for transporting liquids), *Eeberi* (snow-free terrain), *Oschtera* (Easter), *blädera* (chat, gossip).

Where ***ä*** **appears in the medial position of a word,** it is **to be spoken very openly:** *Fägfüür* (purgatory), *Fänschi* (fraying at the end of the whip cord), *ussfänscha* (fray), *nächti* (yesterday evening), *Rächt* (right), *Schärra* (mole), *Bära* (bear), *fääscha* (wrap, bandage), *fäära* (last year), *Schääri* (scissors).

Similarity in dialect pronunciation like between *a* and *e* also exists between ***a*** **and *o*** *(dua, duo), **u*** **and o** *(gnu, gno) **ü*** **and ö** *(gnüttelet, gnöttelet).* We write *dua* (then), *gnu* (taken), *gnüttelet* (nodded).

**The semivowels *j* and *w*** are written **wherever they can be heard:** *trääija* (turn), *chrääija* (crow \[verb\]), *ströuwa* (scatter), *Frouwa* (women). An exception is formed by the place names Treua, Zameia *(Tröija, Zameija* spoken), which are oriented toward the spelling customary today.

## 

## Consonants

**Consonants can be sharpened through their doubling:** *Brügga* (bridge), *Ggraagga* (raven), *sprengga* (blow up). Excepted from this are the fricatives *ch* and *sch,* which anyway appear predominantly sharpened. To avoid burdening the written image, doubling is omitted. I proceed the same way when pronunciation is already sharpened in Swiss German: ***g**ergeret* (annoyed), ***g**lismet* (knitted), ***g**märtet* (bargained), ***g**nütscht* (hit something).

**The exception** applies to those perfect forms **where a g already appears in the stem initial.** As a rule, a strong 'g' is spoken in the participle with corresponding spelling: ***g**iba* (give), ***gg**ä* (given); ***g**aa* (go), ***gg**anga* (gone); ***g**ränggla* (whine), ***gg**rängglet* (whined).

Typical in general is the **sharpening of the stops *b, d, g*** before an **l** to **p, t, gg:** *Buob, Buo**pl**i* (little boy); *Chübelti, Chüpli* (wooden milk vessel); *Stuba* (living room), *Stupli* (alpine or mountain pasture hut); *Hudel, Hutla* (rags); ***Gg**logga* (bell); *na**gg**la* (hammer in nail), ***gg**louba* (believe). Exceptions: *Gang, Geng, Gen**gl**i* (corridor in house and barn, narrow passage); *Bant, Bender, Benli* (ribbon).

**The final consonants *p, ss,* t are as a rule weakened** as soon as a vowel follows them: es *nüws Hemp* (a new shirt), *ds Hemb alegga* (put on the shirt); *är het* (he has), *hüt he**d e**r* (today he has); *chont moora* (comes tomorrow), *chon**d e**rscht moora* (comes only tomorrow); *het sche möga/mö* (has mastered them), *he**d a**ll möga/mö* (has mastered all); *är/er muoss gaa* (he must go), *hüt muo**s ä**r/er gaa* (today he must go); *uss gaa* (go out), *u**s u**nd aab gaa* (out and down go); but *u**ss**ets* (down valley); *ds Loch uss gaa, ds Loch u**s u**nd fort gaa* (go out of the valley and away), *im Huss, im Hu**s a**ab* (down in the house). **No change occurs with *scht* and *cht*** *before* a vowel: *hes**cht** **a**gfanga* (have you started), *chus**cht ä**ppa* (are you finally coming), *hee**cht o**u dert/det* (hangs there too); *is**cht a**gang* (is once).

Frequently ***g*** **also appears sharpened in initial, medial, and final position:** *Ggääschi* (small dilapidated building), *sprengga* (blow up), *Tagg* (day), *Wäggli* (little path), *Zugg* (train, avalanche track).

After short vowels ***tz*** **and *ck* appear as in High German:** *Chatza* (cat), *Blätz* (rag, cloth), *Chätzer* (heretic), *Pfack* (pack), *Seck* (sacks), *Dräck* (dirt), *jetz* (now).

The x-sound is retained where it occurs in the written language. So: *Häx* (witch) and *Xander* (Alexander), but *Fuggs* (fox) and *Aggsla* (armpit). *Ggs* is to be pronounced like an x.

If ***sp*** **and *st* are in the initial position,** they are **to be pronounced as *schp* or** *scht* **respectively:** *Spensa* (pantry) written, *Schpensa* spoken; *stiicha* written (stink), *schtiicha* spoken. However, the same sound in the interior of the word is written as *schp* or *scht: Haschpel* (windlass), *Ascht* (branch), *ischt* (is).

## 

## Prefixes

The prefixes ***ge-, be*** **sharpen** in most cases in the past participle ***b*** to ***bb*** or ***p*** and ***d*** to ***dd*** or ***t**: bätta* (pray) to ***bb**ättet* (prayed); *brälla* (cry) to ***bb**rället* (cried); *bsuocha* (visit) to ***p**suocht* (visited); *bada* (bathe) to ***p**adet* (bathed); *brächa* (break) to ***bb**rocha* (broken); *donnera* (thunder) to ***t**onneret* (thundered); *denka* (think) to ***dd**enkt* (thought); *dichta* (seal, waterproof) to ***t**ichtet* (sealed).

If the base forms already begin with *p* or *t,* we do not double in the participle: *prichta (**p**richtet)* (report), *tua (**t**aa)* (do).

If the prefix ***ge*** stands before ***h**,* ***h*** becomes ***gch**: **gch**ä* (had), ***gch**eecht* (hung), ***gch**olfa* (helped), ***gch**üetet* (guarded).

**In connection with r, the prefix often becomes *gchr:*** ***gch**ruscht* (equipped), ***gch**raata* (advised), ***gch**redt* (talked), ***gch**rägnet* (rained), ***gchr**ächet* (raked grass). However, this form is increasingly disappearing, it can still be heard with the older generation.

In favor of readability, the prefixes *der-, ver-, ze-, zer-,* are predominantly **written with *e*,** even when this only resonates weakly: *d**e**rnaa* (afterwards), *z**e**ggliicha* (the like), *v**e**rtanna* (squander), *z**e**rschlaa* (smash). Forms like *drnaa* or *drvá* are also valid.

## 

## Stress

**The word accent—accent aigu—is only exceptionally set.** Examples: *áhä* (wear, wear a garment), *Spásaaga/Sparrsaga* (small saw clamped in a wooden frame), *Má* (man), *wé* (when), *Mödel* (mold for butter, mold for pastry).

**Word Separations and Phonetic Mergers**

**Each word stands by itself.** So also the shortened pronouns after a verb: *git s* (there is), *geit s* (it goes), *gäänd sch* (they go), *gää wer* (we go), *muos i* (I must), *muos er* (he must).

**Some frequently occurring mergers** from prepositions, pronouns, verbs, articles, and word fragments are, however, listed as independent headwords: *biem* (at him, at oneself), *bima* (at the, at a), *dascht* (that is) etc.

To avoid incorrect reading, a hyphen stands in exceptional cases within the word. Examples: *us-cho* (get along), *us-etza* (feed out), *Huss-Cheer* (housework).

## 

## Approximation

If there are doubts in spelling or if a word sounds almost like in the written language, I follow this. Also where the written image appears too exotic, I proceed this way. Example: *öich* spoken, but *euch* written.

The Valser says *Fals* (Vals), *Flee* (Valé), *Folta* (cellar entrance; cellar stairs). In reference to the foreign-language word origin, we write: *Vals* or in the older form *Valsch, Vlee, Volta* or *Chällervolta.*

## 

## Articles

The definite articles are ***dr, d, ds**.* The indefinite articles are **e and *es* as well as *en***. So: *dr Má, d Frou, ds Chind, d Männer, d Frouwa, d Chind; e Má, e Frou, es Chind* and *en Aart.*

First names in a sentence are always preceded by a definite article: *dr Hannestoni* (Johann-Anton), *d Klaara* (Klara), *ds Franzischgi* (Franziska), *ds Andreesli* (Andreas), *ds Hannesjosepsch Müürta* (Johann-Josef's children).

## 

## Numerals Two, Three, Both

The Vals dialect distinguishes between *zwee/zwei, drii/drüü* and *beed/beedi*—depending on the gender of the following noun. However, these distinctions are increasingly blurring or have partly already disappeared.
