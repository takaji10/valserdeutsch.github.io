# Welcome to the Valser German Dictionary

Valser German (*Vallertütsch*) is the distinctive Walser dialect spoken in the Vals valley of Graubünden, Switzerland. The Walser people migrated to this alpine region during the 13th and 14th centuries, primarily from the neighboring Rheinwald valley and ultimately from Valais. What makes Valser German particularly remarkable is its linguistic isolation—bounded by Romansh-speaking communities down-valley and separated from other Walser settlements by confessional differences, the dialect developed its own unique character. It preserves archaic features not found in neighboring Walser dialects, such as ancient kinship terms like "Ettera" (uncle) and "Enna" (grandfather), while also developing distinctive local innovations that set it apart from the related Rheinwald and Safien dialects.

The richness of Valser German is especially evident in its vocabulary for nature and rural life. The dialect contains an extraordinary variety of words describing weather phenomena—for instance, ten different terms for types of rain—and an elaborate terminology for agricultural practices, particularly relating to hay storage and mountain farming. Though the dialect faces pressures from increased mobility, immigration, and media influence, it remains a vital expression of the community's cultural identity and historical continuity. The vocabulary reflects centuries of alpine life, blending the German brought by medieval Walser settlers with traces of earlier Romansh and Italian influence that remain visible in certain words and place names.
